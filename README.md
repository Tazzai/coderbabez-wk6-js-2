##  Week Six - More Javascript

### Objectives
Update the Puppy Fun House page to responds to more event handlers and selectors.

### Vocab
* Javascript event handler
* JQuery
* Functions

### Review
* What do we use JavaScript for? 
* How do we connect JavaScript to our html?
* What is an event handler?

### Lesson

Take a look at the live site:

* What are the html elements?
* What changes when the button is clicked?


Take a look at the html:

* What's in the html? 
* How is the content initialized?
* How is the content changed when the button is clicked?

##### What are functions?

Functions are reusable sections of code. They are given 0, 1, or many parameters and operate on the page.

Functions look like:

```js
function functionName(paramter) {
  // code
}
```

Functions are called like:
```js
 functionName(value);
```

Don't worry too much about them now. Just know that you can call existing functions.

Find the functions in this project. Look in all the JavaScript files!

##### Update this project

* Add a second button in the header that changes the background color of the page. 
 * What function would you call to get a new color?
 * Align it to the right side of the page

* Add a 4th column
 * Have it update when the other 3 columns are updated
 * How are the columns being selected
 * How will the width of the columns change?
